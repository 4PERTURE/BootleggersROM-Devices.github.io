BootleggersROM:
There are some extra issues to solve but for now, we'll leave that to 4.2. With the addition of the april security patch, we did the following changes:

* Fixed a system hang caused by disabling edge gestures (credits to jenslody)
* Themed All apps search bar on Launcher3 
* Updated Links on Dumpster > About and also, removed G+ because that social network went to the same place our childhood puppy went, hope both come back soon :(
* Fixed a derp with the ShishuOTA overlay on Shishu Nights
* Added missing permissions for Pixel/Devices without debug props for permissions.
* Added some missing headers on OmniStyle
* Fixed glitch on LS Filters for players like Phonograph, Black Player, etc, and also added 2 new effects, accent tinted cover art and grayscaled + blurred cover art.
